# First Try

The initial project that sparked the idea of this repo.  

From this project named 3ta for "3 tier application", I created the project febedb which is more namespace friendly.  .Net doesn't like namespaces that starts with a number.

Then, instead of having 1 project that evolved, I created sub-projects to make it more easier for new comers to find themselves.

I guess this was kept in the repo for reference just in case...

The main work is in the [febedb](..\README.md) (Front End, Back End, DataBase).
